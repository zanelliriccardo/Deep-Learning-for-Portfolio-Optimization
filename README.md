# Deep-Learning-for-Portfolio-Optimization

Implementation of this paper:
[Paper](https://jfds.pm-research.com/content/iijjfds/2/4/8.full.pdf)

Paper describe how to optimize [Sharpe Ratio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharpe_ratio) using deep learning.

Also I tried to change the objective from LSTM to directly optimize Sharpe Ratio in LSTM for prediction and optimize Sharpe Ratio through quadratic programming
